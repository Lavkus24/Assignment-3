I** have implemented a series of RESTful APIs to fulfill the requirements of the assignment. Here's a detailed overview of the functionalities:**
- **Book Session:**
  - Clients can book sessions with consultants based on date and time.
  - Randomly generated Consultant ID and Client ID are used for each session.
  - The API checks slot availability in the existing table and notifies the client accordingly.

- **Session Details:**
  - Two separate APIs cater to clients and consultants for viewing session history and upcoming sessions, respectively.

- **Pre-session Activities:**
  - APIs facilitate pre-session activities, including document selection, access, and upload, for consultants and clients.

- **Upload Feedback:**
  - APIs allow consultants to submit feedback on sessions, and clients can view the provided feedback.
